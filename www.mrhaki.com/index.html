Hello. I am a passoniate Groovy and Java developer based in Tilburg, The Netherlands.
My goal is to write software, like Pixar makes movies, BMW makes cars,
Bang & Olufsen makes audio and TV systems and Apple makes computers and devices:
clean, elegant, user-centered and high quality.
</p>

<p>
My name is Hubert A. Klein Ikkink. Not a very common name, right?
To make things easier I just picked the first letters of my firstname and surname
and came up with haki. So there you have it, now I am known as Mr. Haki or mrhaki for short.
The following Groovy code shows this:
</p>

<p>
<code>assert ['Hubert', 'Alexander', 'Klein', 'Ikkink'].inject('mr') { c,n -> c += n[0].toLowerCase() } == 'mrhaki'</code>
</p>

In 2009 I started writing blog posts about Groovy with the name
<a href="http://mrhaki.blogspot.com/search/label/Groovy%3AGoodness">Groovy Goodness</a>.
These posts contain small snippets of code explaining core and exotic features of
the Groovy language.
