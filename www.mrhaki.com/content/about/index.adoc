== Me

pass:attributes[<img src="{imagesdir}/jdriven-photo.png" alt="Photo" width="128" height="128" align="left" class="photo">] My name is Hubert Klein Ikkink, but I am also known as mrhaki.
I am born in 1973 and live in Tilburg, The Netherlands, with my three gorgeous children. +
I studied Information Systems and Management at the Tilburg University.
After finishing my study I started to work at a company specialized in knowledge based software.
There I started writing my first Java software (yes, an applet!) in 1996. +
During the years my focus switched from applets, to servlets, to Java Enterprise Edition, to Spring based software. 
At that same company I also was inspired by a colleague to write articles about Java (and Borland JBuilder) for magazines.
From that I was also invited to speak at the Borland conference and local meetups about Java. +
In 2008 I wanted to have fun again when writing software.
The larger projects I was working on were more about writing configuration XML files, tuning performance and less about _real_ development in my eyes.
So I started to look around and noticed Groovy as a very good language to learn about.
I could still use existing Java code and libraries and can use my Groovy classes in Java.
The learning curve isn't steep and to support my learning phase I wrote down interesting Groovy facts in http://www.mrhaki.com/blog[my blog] with the title _Groovy Goodness_.
I post small articles with a lot of code samples to understand how to use Groovy.
And since November 2011 I am also a DZone Most Valuable Blogger (MVB), where DZone also posts my blog items on their site.

== Writer

I have written three books about Gradle that are published by Packt Publishing.
I also bundled a lot of my blog posts into books published at Leanpub.
Checkout the pass:attributes[<a href="/books.html">Books</a>] page for more information.

I also published several articles in Java Magazine which is a quarterly magazine published by the dutch Java user group NLJUG.

== Speaker

In recent years I was invited to speak at http://gr8conf.eu[Gr8Conf] in Copenhagen, Denmark and  at https://gr8conf.us[Gr8Conf US] in Minneapolis, USA.
This is very good conference with all project leaders of Groovy and Groovy-related projects.
So it was a great honor to be invited and to speak at the conference about my Groovy, Grails and Gradle Goodness posts.
I also presented a talks about Gradle, Micronaut, Ratpack and Asciidoctor at the J-Fall conference of the Dutch Java User Group.
The conference is visited by 1000 Java developers and I got the chance to educate some of them about some nice Java frameworks and tools. +
From 2016 I spoke about Asciidoctor and Micronaut at Javaland in Germany.
A community driven Java conference at the Phantasialand amusement park. +
I spoke also at several meetups and local meetings about various subjects like Groovy, Clojure, Gradle, Asciidoctor and much more.

== Developer

pass:attributes[<img src="{imagesdir}/logo-jdriven.png" alt=JDriven width=72 height=72 align="left" class="photo"/>]
I work at the great IT company https://www.jdriven.com/[JDriven].
Here I work on projects with Groovy & Grails, Gradle and Spring.
At JDriven we focus on agile, enterpris technologies.
All colleagues want to learn new technologies, support craftmanship and are very eager to learn.
This is truly a great environment to work in.
