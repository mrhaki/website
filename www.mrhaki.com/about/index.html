        My name is Hubert Klein Ikkink, but I am also known as mrhaki. I am born in 1973 and live
        in Tilburg, The Netherlands, with my beautiful wife and three gorgeous children.
        <br />
        I studied Information Systems and Management at the Tilburg University. After finishing
        my study I started to work at a company specialized in knowledge based software. There
        I started writing my first Java software (yes, an applet!) in 1996. During the years
        my focus switched from applets, to servlets, to Java Enterprise Edition, to Spring based software.
        <br />
        In 2008 I wanted to have fun again when writing software. The larger projects I was working on
        were more about writing configuration XML files, tuning performance and less about <em>real</em>
        development in my eyes. So I started to look around and noticed Groovy as a very good language
        to learn about. I could still use existing Java code and libraries and can use my Groovy
        classes in Java. The learning curve isn't steep and to support my learning phase I wrote down
        interesting Groovy facts in <a href="http://www.mrhaki.com/blog">my blog</a> with the title
        <em>Groovy Goodness</em>. I post small articles with a lot of code samples to understand
        how to use Groovy. And since November 2011 I am also a DZone Most Valuable Blogger (MVB),
        where DZone also posts my blog items on their site.

        In 2012 I have written the book
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1849518106/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1849518106&linkCode=as2&tag=mrhakicom-20">Gradle Effective Implementation Guide</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mrhakicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1849518106" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
        for Packt Publishing.
        The book is a great introduction and reference for using Gradle.
        The Gradle build language is explained with hands on code and practical applications.
        You learn how to apply Gradle in your Java, Scala or Groovy projects, integrate with your favorite
        IDE and how to integrate with well-known continuous integration servers.
        <br />
        Start with the foundations and work your way through hands on examples to build your knowledge of Gradle to skyscraper heights. You will quickly learn the basics of Gradle, how to write tasks, work with files and how to use write build scripts using the Groovy DSL. Then as you develop you will be shown how to use Gradle for Java projects. Compile, package, test and deploy your applications with ease. When youâ€™ve mastered the simple, move on to the sublime and integrate your code with continuous integration servers and IDEs. By the end of the "Gradle Effective Implementation Guide" you will be able to use Gradle in your daily development. Writing tasks, applying plugins and creating build logic will be second nature.

        <a href="http://www.leanpub.com/groovy-goodness-notebook"><img align="left" class="photo" src="http://titlepages.leanpub.com/groovy-goodness-notebook/small" /></a> In 2013 I have bundled the Groovy Goodness blog posts into a single electronic publication: Groovy Goodness Notebook. The book contains the blog posts bundled into categories. The posts have been slightly edited, but mainly for formatting purposes. It gives a broad and in-depth overview of common and more hidden features of Groovy. Features are explained with a lot of code, so it is very practical.
        <br />
        The book is published at <a href="http://www.leanpub.com">Leanpub</a> and is available in three formats: PDF, MOBI (for Kindle) and EPUB (for iPad). Updates are available for free. So any new Groovy Goodness blog posts will be added to the book and those updates are free if you have bought the book.

Just like the Groovy Goodness Notebook does the book contain the blog posts bundled into categories. This time the posts are of course about Grails instead of Groovy. The posts have been slightly edited, but mainly for formatting purposes. It gives a broad and in-depth overview of common and more hidden features of Grails. Features are explained with a lot of code, so it is very practical.

    <h2 style="clear:both">Speaker</h2>
    <p>
        In 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 I was invited to speak at <a href="http://gr8conf.eu">Gr8Conf</a> in Copenhagen, Denmark. And in 2014 also at <a href="http://gr8conf.us">Gr8Conf US</a> in Minneapolis, USA.
        This is very good conference with all project leaders of Groovy and Groovy-related
        projects. So it was a great honor to be invited and to speak at the conference about my
        Groovy Goodness posts. You can see a Youtube video about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmWrjIhOq-s">Grails Goodness</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7u38U0HFw">Groovy Goodness</a> I presented at Gr8Conf 2013 and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSnsi6wd6GA">Gradle Goodness</a> at Gr8Conf 2014.
        <br/>
        In november 2010 I presented a Gradle talk at the J-Fall conference of the Dutch Java User Group.
        And in november 2011 I presented about the new features in Groovy 1.8 at the same conference. During the 2013 edition
        I presented a hands-on Gradle workshop.
        The conference is visited by 1000 Java developers and I got the chance to educate some of them
        about the greatness of Gradle and Groovy.

    <p>
        I work at the great IT company
        <a href="http://www.jdriven.com/">JDriven</a>.
        Here I work on projects with Groovy &amp; Grails, Gradle and Spring.
        At <nobr>JDriven</nobr> we focus on SpringSource technologies.
        All colleagues want to learn new technologies, support craftmanship
        and are very
        eager to learn. This is truly a great environment to work in.
