    <h2>Me</h2>

    <p>
        <img src="/images/photo.png" alt="Photo" width="128" height="128" align="left" class="photo"/>
        My name is Hubert Klein Ikkink, but I am also known as mrhaki. I am born in 1973 and live
        in Tilburg, The Netherlands, with my beautiful wife and two gorgeous children.
        <br />
        I studied Information Systems and Management at the Tilburg University. After finishing
        my study I started to work at a company specialized in knowledge based software. There
        I started writing my first Java software (yes, an applet!) in 1996. During the years
        my focus switched from applets, to servlets, to Java Enterprise Edition, to Spring based software.
        <br />
        In 2008 I wanted to have fun again when writing software. The larger projects I was working on
        were more about writing configuration XML files, tuning performance and less about <em>real</em>
        development in my eyes. So I started to look around and noticed Groovy as a very good language
        to learn about. I could still use existing Java code and libraries and can use my Groovy
        classes in Java. The learning curve isn't steep and to support my learning phase I wrote down
        interesting Groovy facts in <a href="http://www.mrhaki.com/blog">my blog</a> with the title
        <em>Groovy Goodness</em>. I post small articles with a lot of code samples to understand
        how to use Groovy.
    </p>

    <h2>Speaking</h2>
    <p>
        In 2010 and 2011 I was invited to speak at <a href="http://gr8conf.org">Gr8Conf</a> in Copenhagen, Denmark.
        This is very good conference with all project leaders of Groovy and Groovy-related
        projects. So it was a great honor to be invited and to speak at the conference about my
        Groovy Goodness posts.
        <br/>
        In november 2010 I presented a Gradle talk at the J-Fall conference of the Dutch Java User Group.
        And in november 2011 I presented about the new features in Groovy 1.8 at the same conference.
        The conference is visited by 1000 Java developers and I got the chance to educate some of them
        about the greatness of Gradle.

    <h2>VX Company</h2>

    <p>
        Currently I am working at the great IT company
        <a href="http://www.vxcompany.com/SoftwareOntwikkeling/Java/Paginas/default.aspx">VX Company</a>.
        I get to work on innovative projects with Groovy &amp; Grails, Gradle and Java.
        At <nobr>VX Company</nobr> we have a Java business unit focused on working with Java and Groovy on
        pojects for different customers. All colleagues want to learn new technologies, support craftmanship
        and are very
        eager to learn. This is truly a great environment to work in.
        <br />
        VX Company also gives workshops about Groovy and Grails presented by me. These workshops are a great
        way to start with Groovy and Grails, because it is hands-on with code labs to immediately try
        out Groovy and Grails.
