    <h2>Me</h2>

    <p>
        <img src="/images/photo.png" alt="Photo" width="128" height="128" align="left" class="photo"/>
        My name is Hubert Klein Ikkink, but I am also known as mrhaki. I am born in 1973 and live
        in Tilburg, The Netherlands, with my beautiful wife and two gorgeous children.
        <br />
        I studied Information Systems and Management at the Tilburg University. After finishing
        my study I started to work at a company specialized in knowledge based software. There
        I started writing my first Java software (yes, an applet!) in 1996. During the years
        my focus switched from applets, to servlets, to Java Enterprise Edition, to Spring based software.
        <br />
        In 2008 I wanted to have fun again when writing software. The larger projects I was working on
        were more about writing configuration XML files, tuning performance and less about <em>real</em>
        development in my eyes. So I started to look around and noticed Groovy as a very good language
        to learn about. I could still use existing Java code and libraries and can use my Groovy
        classes in Java. The learning curve isn't steep and to support my learning phase I wrote down
        interesting Groovy facts in <a href="http://www.mrhaki.com/blog">my blog</a> with the title
        <em>Groovy Goodness</em>. I post small articles with a lot of code samples to understand
        how to use Groovy. And since November 2011 I am also a DZone Most Valuable Blogger (MVB),
        where DZone also posts my blog items on their site.

    <h2>Speaking</h2>
    <p>
        In 2010, 2011 and 2012 I was invited to speak at <a href="http://gr8conf.org">Gr8Conf</a> in Copenhagen, Denmark.
        This is very good conference with all project leaders of Groovy and Groovy-related
        projects. So it was a great honor to be invited and to speak at the conference about my
        Groovy Goodness posts.
        <br/>
        In november 2010 I presented a Gradle talk at the J-Fall conference of the Dutch Java User Group.
        And in november 2011 I presented about the new features in Groovy 1.8 at the same conference.
        The conference is visited by 1000 Java developers and I got the chance to educate some of them
        about the greatness of Gradle and Groovy.

    <h2>JDriven</h2>

    <p>
        I work at the great IT company
        <a href="http://www.jdriven.com/">JDriven</a>.
        Here I work on projects with Groovy &amp; Grails, Gradle and Spring.
        At <nobr>JDriven</nobr> we focus on SpringSource technologies.
        All colleagues want to learn new technologies, support craftmanship
        and are very
        eager to learn. This is truly a great environment to work in.
